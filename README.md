Homepage/loginpage and registerpage UI is made using react and then it is connected to the API requests- response via AxiosCreated a Rest API using Node.js for authentication of users and dealing with database. 

#Packages used:

##Axios
Axios is a promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node. js. Axios makes it easy to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations. It can be used in plain JavaScript or with a library such as Vue or React.

##Cors
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests that are initiated from scripts running in the browser. If your REST API's resources receive non-simple cross-origin HTTP requests, you need to enable CORS support.

##Cookie-Parser
cookie-parser is a middleware which parses cookies attached to the client request object. To use it, we will require it in our index. js file; this can be used the same way as we use other middleware. Here, we will use the following code. var cookieParser = require('cookie-parser'); app.
